  <h1><br>Cake Bake</h1>
  <p>Cake Bake is a simple and short game where your only task is to bake a cake. To do this, you select three ingredients, and my character does the rest. <br><br> Cake Bake was orginally made for a contest entry, but hit unexpected success when the Scratch Team decided to feature it on the main page. This lead to it getting more than 100,000 views. From that point on, I expanded the game, reaching 100 cakes. Even if its time on the main page is over, Cake Bake is still being played today. I will never forgot the day I opened scratch.mit's website and saw my game.</p>
